# React Movie App

A simple and modern movie browser built with React and Vite, using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch and display movie data. This project is designed as a practical way to learn React fundamentals, including hooks, context, routing, and component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Browse Popular Movies:**  
  View a grid of trending movies fetched from the TMDB API.

- **Search Movies:**  
  Search for movies by title using the search bar.

- **Favorites:**  
  Add or remove movies from your favorites. Favorites are saved in your browserâ€™s local storage.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Clean and responsive UI for desktop and mobile.

- **Routing:**  
  Navigate between Home and Favorites pages using React Router.

- **Reusable Components:**  
  Modular components like `MovieCard` and `NavBar` for maintainability.

- **Global State with Context:**  
  Favorites are managed globally using React Context.

## Learning Objectives

- Fetch and display data from an external API
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- Manage global state with React Context
- Implement client-side routing with React Router
- Build and compose reusable UI components
- Persist data with localStorage

## Customization

- To use your own TMDB API key, edit [`src/services/api.js`](src/services/api.js) and replace the `API_KEY` value.
